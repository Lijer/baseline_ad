The source code includes three files:rankod.py, rankod_sparse.py, and utilities.py.

rankod.py is used for learning representations of dense data sets.
rankod_sparse.py is used for learning representations of very sparse data sets.
utilities.py contains some common functions used in both rankod.py and rankod_sparse.py.

Environment: Keras with Tensorflow as backend

Updates at 19 Nov 2019: Changing the way of loading model so that the code works in different versions of Keras/tensorflow
